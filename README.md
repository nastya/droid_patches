# droid_patches

In order to apply patches switch to a directory corresponding to a specific project (e.g. cd frameworks/base/) and apply a corresponding patch (e.g. frameworks_base.patch) using command:
```
    patch -p1 < <patch name>.patch
```
where <patch name>.patch is a name of the chosen patch file to apply.
